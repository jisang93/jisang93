Hi, Iâ€™m an AI research engineer currently focusing on `speech synthesis`, `singing voice synthesis`, and `vocoder`. I received my M.S. degree in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Korea University in 2024, advised by Seong-Whan Lee.

## ðŸ‘€ Research Interests
- Speech Synthesis
- Singing Voice Synthesis
- Generative Models
- Natural Language Processing
